    "**Q1.** This question provides some practice cleaning variables which have common problems.\n",
    "1. Numeric variable: For `./data/airbnb_hw.csv`, clean the `Price` variable as well as you can, and explain the choices you make. How many missing values do you end up with? (Hint: What happens to the formatting when a price goes over 999 dollars, say from 675 to 1,112?)\n",
    "2. Categorical variable: For the Minnesota police use of for data, `./data/mn_police_use_of_force.csv`, clean the `subject_injury` variable, handling the NA's; this gives a value `Yes` when a person was injured by police, and `No` when no injury occurred. What proportion of the values are missing? Is this a concern? Cross-tabulate your cleaned `subject_injury` variable with the `force_type` variable. Are there any patterns regarding when the data are missing? \n",
    "3. Dummy variable: For the pretrial data covered in the lecture, clean the `WhetherDefendantWasReleasedPretrial` variable as well as you can, and, in particular, replace missing values with `np.nan`.\n",
    "4. Missing values, not at random: For the pretrial data covered in the lecture, clean the `ImposedSentenceAllChargeInContactEvent` variable as well as you can, and explain the choices you make. (Hint: Look at the `SentenceTypeAllChargesAtConvictionInContactEvent` variable.)"

    "### Answer\n",
    "1. This paper is about tidy data and common tools that can be used to clean large and messy data sets. I think it will address thing sthat can be used to streamline the tedious proccess of data cleaning. It may address tools that could be used universally to get started across different datasets.\n",
    "2. The tidy data standard makes cleaning easier and allows people to engage with and explore data more easily. It allows for the creation of data cleaning tools as well. This is especially helpful when dealing with real-life data.\n",
    "3. Tidy datasets present a sort of standardized structure that is true across all sets. At the same time, they aren't not entirely clean. From what I understand, tidy data is an initial step to exploration. It makes cleaning easier, but being tidy doesn't mean the data is clean. Therefore, once the data is tidy, steps are subjective to the dataset we are working with.\n",
    "4. Values are defined as numbers and strings that make up a dataset. Variables are the element in common being measured, the independent variable. Observations are the rest of the attributes being measured on that specific variable, they are \"values measured on the same unit.\"\n",
    "5. In tidy data sets each variable creates a column, each observation maps a row, and the observational unit types make up a table.\n",
    "6. Column headers are values and not variable names, multiple variables are being store in one column (should be one variable per column), variables are stored in columns and rows (they should be mapping columns), multiple types of different observational units are being stored in the same table, and conversely, a single observational unit being stored across multiple tables. Table 4 is a tabular dataset, it's columns are headed by values not variable names and variables are forming both the rows and the columns. Melting a dataset is turning columns into rows since they are formed by variables and not observations. Frequency is being determined by religion and income here. We want to be able to observe these separately across columns mapped to the specific variables. So, we stack the columns on top of each other to create rows (values are stack on top of each other and other variables are repeated when needed according to toy dataset).\n",
    "7. Table 11 is tabular, with a column for each day in the month. When the data is tidied this is stacked into a date column, and then the data is moltened so that tmax and tmin are also columns of their own, that relate to the date based on their rows/observations.\n",
    "8. The \"chicken-egg problem\" refers to the tools that are used with tidy data and the tidy data itself. Tidy data is not as helpful without the tools that work with it, and the tools cannot be used without tidy data. These things are mutuallly dependent. There is not much wiggle room with this tidy standard for anything to further change."

    "This is a really complicated column to clean. I'm unsure that I have the tools to fully clean it, but I found and located the number of times the word \"white\" was mentioned and divided by the total number of attacks. This should give us a good sense of how many attacks involved white sharks about 10.67%."

How should future large scale surveys be adjusted to best reflect the diversity of the population? Could some of the Census' good practices be adopted more widely to gather richer and more useful data?\n",
